Computer Vision/Image Processing Feature Building:

1. Basically we want to take photos pretty regularly, but sort them for each person
2. Every unique person should have their own folder, so if a photo is taken, determine who it is
3. If it is a new person, we need to create a new folder for them
4. If a photo does not have a face in it, then we throw it away, it does not get stored
5. We will use supabase to store the photos, I have tables for encounters, people, and face embeddings.
6. Photos should not be triggered by button press, it should just happen pretty regularly and get sorted accordingly.
7. We want to frame a person's face by cropping the picture of the face to get a better centered photo of them.
